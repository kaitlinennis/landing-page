# Landing Page Project
This project allowed me to practice my frontend skills using HTML and CSS.
As I recently learned flexbox, this project let me implement the concepts
I learned into building a web page design from scratch. Overall this project
helped me learn more about how to position elements the way I want 
and create a useful layout on a web page.

I replicated this web page design from a screenshot provided to me
(via The Odin Project https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).
